      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>Dream Nudge was created by <b>Young Innovators</b> from SMK Tunku Putera. Our goal was to rethink the alarm clock and provide a solution to common sleep issues.</p>
    </section>

    <section class='reveal'>
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>We believe that waking up should be a peaceful, gentle experience. That‚Äôs why we designed Dream Nudge, a silent vibrational pillow alarm. It was created to solve problems like sleep deprivation, stress, and screen overload ‚Äî promoting better physical and mental wellness.</p>
      <p><i>Say goodbye to loud alarms and groggy mornings, and hello to peaceful sleep, gentle wake-ups, and better focus.</i></p>
    </section>

    <section class='reveal'>
      <h2>Product Concept & Features</h2>
      <p>Dream Nudge is a silent, vibrational pillow alarm with a compact vibration module embedded within the pillow‚Äôs foam layer, paired with a citrus scent diffuser. Control is simple: use the button on the pillow or the companion app to set sleep modes or custom times.</p>
